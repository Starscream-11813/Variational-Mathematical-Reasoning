Answer: 63. The chef needs to cook 15 potatoes in total, and he has already cooked 8, so he needs to cook 15 - 8 = 7 more potatoes. Since each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, it will take the chef 7 x 9 = 63 minutes to cook the rest.

Answer: 63
--- 147 120009
There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but one possible method is:

Let x be the number of potatoes the chef has already cooked.
Then the total number of potatoes is 15, so the number of potatoes left to cook is 15 - x.
The cooking time for each potato is 9 minutes, so the total cooking time for the remaining potatoes is (15 - x) * 9 = 135 - 9x minutes.
We know that the chef has already cooked some potatoes, and it took him 63 minutes to cook the rest, so we can write the equation:
(15 - x) * 9 = 63
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
15 - x = 7
x = 8

Therefore, the chef has already cooked 8 potatoes.
The output should be:
8
--- 148 130009
Answer: 6
--- 149 140009
The chef took a total of (15 x 9) = 135 minutes to cook all 15 potatoes.
If it took him 63 minutes to finish cooking the rest of them, then he must have already spent (135 - 63) = 72 minutes cooking the first batch of potatoes.
Therefore, he already cooked (72/9) = 8 potatoes.

First, we need to find out how much Enrique earns in a week since we know he works 40 hours a week. Let's assume he earns $x per week, then his total earnings in a month (4 weeks) would be 4x.

Next, we can use the given percentage to find out how much he puts into the IRA each month:
12% = 0.12 (as a decimal)
0.12 * 4x = 0.48x

We know that $72 is the amount he invests in the IRA, so we can set up an equation:
0.48x = $72

Solving for x:
x = $150

Therefore, his monthly paycheck was $600.
Output: 600
--- 181 1200011
480
--- 182 1300011
Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that Enrique puts 12% of his monthly paycheck in an IRA, which means that:

0.12 * monthly paycheck = amount invested in IRA

2. We also know that he invests $72 in the IRA, so we can set up an equation:

0.12 * monthly paycheck = 72

3. Solving for monthly paycheck:

monthly paycheck = 72 / 0.12

monthly paycheck = 600

4. Finally, we need to find out how much his monthly mortgage payment is:

monthly mortgage payment = $1200

Therefore, Enrique's monthly paycheck was $600 for this specific month. 

To output the answer in the required format, the final output will be:

First, we need to find out how much money James has left after buying new paint brushes. 

Amount left = Total money - Cost of paint brushes 
Amount left = $19 - $11 
Amount left = $8 

Now, we can divide the amount left by the cost of each book to find out how many books James can buy. 

Number of books = Amount left / Cost per book 
Number of books = $8 / $2 
Number of books = 4

First, we need to subtract the cost of the mower blades from the amount Frank made:
$19 - $11 = $8
Next, we need to figure out how many $2 games he could buy with the $8 he has left:
$8 ÷ $2 = 4
Therefore, Frank could buy 4 $2 games with the money he has left.

First, we need to calculate how much money Frank earned mowing lawns. He spent $11 on new mower blades, so he had $19 - $11 = $8 left over. 

Next, we need to figure out how many hours Frank worked to earn that money. We know he earned $5 per hour, so we can divide $8 by $5 to get 1.6 hours. Since he can't work a fraction of an hour, we can round up to 2 hours. 

Now, we can calculate how much money Frank would earn in 2 hours. At a rate of $5 per hour, Frank would earn 2 x $5 = $10. 

Finally, we can figure out how many $2 games he could buy with the money he has left. He has $8 - $10 = -$2. Since he has negative money, he can't buy any $2 games. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve the problem, we need to find the point where the cost for both plans are equal. Let's assume that Goran needs to drive x miles.

For the first plan, the cost will be: 
65 + 0.40x

For the second plan, the cost will be: 
0.60x

We want to find the value of x where the cost for both plans is the same:

65 + 0.40x = 0.60x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

65 = 0.20x

x = 325

Therefore, Goran needs to drive 325 miles for the two plans to cost the same.

Answer: 325
--- 391 100024
To find the number of miles that would make both plans cost the same, we need to set the two plan's costs equal to each other and solve for miles. Let's call the number of miles driven "m":
Plan 1 cost = 0.4m + 65
Plan 2 cost = 0.6m

0.4m + 65 = 0.6m

65 = 0.2m

m = 325

Therefore, Maria would need to drive 325 miles for the 2 plans to cost the same.

Answer: 162.5
--- 393 300024
First, we need to set up an equation where the cost of both plans is equal. 

Let x be the number of miles driven. 

For the first plan: 
Cost = 0.4x + 65 

For the second plan: 
Cost = 0.6x 

Setting both equations equal to each other: 
0.4x + 65 = 0.6x 

Solving for x: 
0.2x = 65 
x = 325 

Therefore, Sarah would need to drive 325 miles for the two plans to cost the same.

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of hours worked on Saturday and Sunday from the total hours worked to find the hours worked on Friday. Then, we can multiply this number by the hourly rate to find the amount earned on Friday. Finally, we can subtract this amount from the total amount earned to find the amount earned on Saturday and Sunday combined.

Total hours worked = hours on Friday + hours on Saturday + hours on Sunday

Let x be the number of hours Dana worked on Friday.

x + 10 + 3 = total hours worked

x + 13 = total hours worked

Amount earned on Friday = x * $13

Total amount earned = $286

Total amount earned = amount earned on Friday + amount earned on Saturday and Sunday

$286 = x * $13 + (10+3)*$13

$286 = 13x + 169

13x = 117

x = 9

First, we need to subtract the cost of the dog toys from the money Ben made over the summer: 

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars 

Next, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each game: 

45 dollars ÷ 5 dollars per game = 9 games 

Answer: 9

Answer: 9
--- 906 600054
To know how many 5 dollar games Mike can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the mower blades:
69 - 24 = 45
Now we can divide the money he has left by the price of each game:
45 / 5 = 9

Answer: 9
--- 911 1100054
First, we need to determine how much money Mike has left after buying new mower blades. 

Money left = 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars

Next, we need to determine how many 5 dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left. 

Number of 5 dollar games = Money left / Cost per game 

Number of 5 dollar games = 45 dollars / 5 dollars 

Number of 5 dollar games = 9

Answer: 8
--- 1135 1400067
First, we need to calculate how many of the 48 hours were regular hours (not overtime). Since Soledad earns 1.5 times her regular hourly wage for overtime, we know that her overtime hours must be 1/2 of her total overtime earnings.

Overtime pay = total pay - (regular hours x regular pay)
Overtime pay = $442 - (40 hours x regular pay)
Overtime pay = $442 - 40r, where r is the regular hourly wage

Overtime hours = overtime pay / (1.5 x regular pay)
Overtime hours = ($442 - 40r) / (1.5r)

Total hours = regular hours + overtime hours
48 = regular hours + ($442 - 40r) / (1.5r)

Multiplying both sides by 1.5r gives:
72r = 48(1.5r) + 442 - 40r

Simplifying terms gives:
72r = 72r + 442
442 = 0r

Therefore, Soledad's regular hourly wage is 0 dollars. This is likely an error or a typo in the word problem.

To find out the amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe, we need to subtract the amount of oil that leaked before the engineers started from the total amount of oil leaked.

Amount of oil leaked while engineers fixed the pipe = Total amount of oil leaked - Amount of oil leaked before engineers started
Amount of oil leaked while engineers fixed the pipe = 6206 - 2475
Amount of oil leaked while engineers fixed the pipe = 3731

Therefore, the amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe is 3731 gallons.

Answer: 3731
--- 1219 1300072
To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount of oil that leaked before engineers started from the total amount leaked. 

Total amount leaked = 6206 gallons 

Amount leaked before engineers started = 2475 gallons 

Amount leaked while engineers were fixing the pipe = Total amount leaked - Amount leaked before engineers started 

Amount leaked while engineers were fixing the pipe = 6206 - 2475 

Amount leaked while engineers were fixing the pipe = 3731 

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 7
--- 1302 1100077
First, we can find the total number of students who were put into groups by multiplying the number of groups by the number of students per group: 4 groups x 7 students per group = 28 students in groups.
To find how many students were not picked, we subtract the number of students in groups from the total number of students: 64 students - 28 students in groups = 36 students not picked.
Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 17
--- 1370 1100081
First, we need to find the total number of students who tried out: 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students
Then we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total: 43 - 26 = 17 students who didn't make the cut.
Since there were 15 basketballs available and only 26 students were called back, it means that at least 11 of the students who got called back did not receive a basketball for practice. Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut is 17 + 11 = 28
Answer: 28
--- 1371 1200081
To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of students who made the cut from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students

Number of students who made the cut = 26

Therefore, the number of students who didn't make the cut = 43 - 26 = 17

Answer: 17
--- 1372 1300081
Out of the 43 students who tried out, 26 were chosen, so 17 were not chosen.
If 17 students equals 100%, then 1 student equals 5.88% (1 / 17 = 0.0588).
Therefore, the total number of students in the school who didn't make the cut is: 0.0588 x 1200 = 70.56.
Answer: 71.
--- 1373 1400081
To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 + 4 = 43
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 43 - 26 = 17

--- 1740 7000103
To find out how many problems Paige had to do for homework, we need to subtract the 44 problems she finished at school from the total number of homework problems:

Total homework problems = 43 math problems + 12 science problems
Total homework problems = 55 problems

Homework problems remaining = Total homework problems - Problems finished at school
Homework problems remaining = 55 - 44
Homework problems remaining = 11

Therefore, Paige had 11 problems to do for homework.

Answer: 11
--- 1741 8000103
To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of problems Paige had for homework. 

Total number of problems = number of math problems + number of science problems 

Total number of problems = 43 + 12 

Total number of problems = 55 

If Paige finished 44 problems at school, then the number of problems left for homework is: 

Number of problems for homework = total number of problems - problems finished at school 

Number of problems for homework = 55 - 44 

Number of problems for homework = 11 

Therefore, Paige had 11 problems to do for homework.

To find out how many problems Paige finished at school, we need to subtract the total number of problems from the ones she had left to do. 
Total number of problems = 43 (math) + 12 (science) = 55
Problems Paige finished at school = 55 - 11 = 44

First, Mrs. Hilt saw 144 bees in the hive. The next day, she saw 3 times that many which is 144 x 3 = 432 bees.
Therefore, Mrs. Hilt saw 432 bees on the second day.

To find the total number of books, we need to first find the total number of shelves she has for the books. 

Number of shelves for mystery books = 3
Number of shelves for picture books = 5

Total number of shelves = 3 + 5 = 8

Now, we can find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Number of shelves x Number of books on each shelf
Total number of books = 8 x 9
Total number of books = 72

Adding the 12 umbrellas, the total number of items becomes:

Total items = Total number of books + Number of umbrellas
Total items = 72 + 12
Total items = 84

Therefore, answering the question:

The amount Samantha wanted to spend on records is $6.16, so it's not relevant to the total amount spent. 
The total cost is:
$136.01 (headphones) + $139.38 (record player) + $112.46 (bike tires) = $387.85

Adding up all the amounts that David spent, we get:

$136.01 + $139.38 + $112.46 = $387.85

Keith spent $136.01 on speakers. 

Explanation: 
Let's set up an equation. Keith originally planned to spend $6.16 on 3 CD's. Therefore, he has $387.85 - $6.16 = $381.69 left to spend. 

Let S be the amount he spent on speakers. We know he spent $139.38 on a CD player, $112.46 on new tires, and S on speakers. Therefore:

S + $139.38 + $112.46 = $381.69

Simplifying: 

S = $381.69 - $139.38 - $112.46 

S = $129.85

Therefore, Keith spent $129.85 on speakers.
--- 2330 16000143
To find out how much Keith spent on speakers, we need to subtract the cost of the CD player, new tires, and the 3 CDs he didn't buy from the total amount he spent: 

$387.85 - $139.38 - $112.46 - $6.16 = $129.85 

Therefore, Keith spent $129.85 on speakers.

First, we need to find out how many total coins Sam had before his dad gave him more. 
Total coins = 49 pennies + 24 nickels = 49 + (24x5) = 49 + 120 = 169 coins.

After his dad gave him more coins, he had:
24 + 39 = 63 nickels
31 quarters = 31 x 25 = 775 cents = 155 nickels

Total nickels after his dad gave him more = 63 + 155 = 218 nickels.

Therefore, the answer is:

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the amount Mike spent on mower blades from the amount he earned:

101 dollars - 47 dollars = 54 dollars

Then, we need to divide the amount left by the cost of each game:

54 dollars / 6 dollars = 9 games.

So, Mike can buy 9 games with the money he had left.

To find out how much money Mike had left, we need to subtract the cost of the new mower blades from the amount he earned. 

101 dollars - 47 dollars = 54 dollars

Now we subtract the cost of the 6 dollar games that Mike wants to buy:

54 dollars - (6 dollars x 6 games) = 18 dollars

Answer: 1429. - The monthly cost for the first plan can be represented by the equation 50 + 0.35(x-500), where x is the number of minutes used. The monthly cost for the second plan can be represented by the equation 75 + 0.45(x-1000). To find the point where the two costs are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x: 

50 + 0.35(x-500) = 75 + 0.45(x-1000)

0.1x = 95

x = 950

So, the monthly costs of the plans are equal at 950 minutes.

To solve the problem, we can start by setting up a proportion:

Jessica's share / Dan's share = 56 / (Jessica's share + Dan's share)

Let x be the number of shells in Jessica's share, then:

x / 22 = 56 / (x + 22)

Multiplying both sides by (x + 22) and simplifying:

x(x + 22) = 22 * 56

x^2 + 22x = 1232

x^2 + 22x - 1232 = 0

Factoring:

(x - 28)(x + 50) = 0

Therefore, x = 28 (since x cannot be negative)

So Jessica received 28 shells and Dan kept 22 - 28 = -6 shells (which doesn't make sense), so we assume that there was a mistake in the problem statement.

To find out how much Benny spent on his baseball gear, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he received:

9 movie tickets + $79 = $88

Then, we can subtract the amount he has left from the total amount to get the amount he spent:

$88 - $32 = $56

Therefore, Benny spent $56 on his baseball gear.

First, we need to calculate the amount the carpenter charges for labor. We subtract the cost of materials from the total quote: 

980 - 560 = 420 dollars 

We can divide the labor cost by the hourly fee to find the number of hours it would take: 

420 / 28 = 15 hours 

Therefore, it will take 15 hours to complete the task. 

Answer: 15
--- 2816 3000217
Answer: 20
--- 2817 4000217
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Total cost = (hourly rate x time) + cost of materials

We know that the hourly rate is $28, the cost of materials is $560, and the total cost is $980. We need to find the time it will take to finish building the patio cover. 

Let's plug in the values we know into the formula and solve for time:

$980 = ($28 x time) + $560

$420 = $28 x time

time = 15 hours

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 15
--- 2818 5000217
To find the amount of time it will take to complete the project, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total cost and then divide the result by the carpenter's hourly rate. 

Total cost - Cost of supplies = Cost of labor
980 dollars - 560 dollars = 420 dollars

Cost of labor / Hourly rate = Time in hours
420 dollars / 28 dollars per hour = 15 hours

After 2 hours, the painter has completed 2/6 = 1/3 of the job.
So, the fraction of the job left = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.
In one hour, the painter can complete 1/6 of the job and the helper can complete 1/10 of the job.
Working together, they can complete 1/6 + 1/10 = 4/30 + 3/30 = 7/30 of the job in one hour.
So, the time they will take to complete the remaining 2/3 of the job = (2/3) / (7/30) = 20/7 hours.
Therefore, the final answer is: Answer: 2.85714285714 or Answer: 20/7. (Both forms are acceptable.)

First, we need to find how much work can be done by the painter in 2 hours. We know that the painter can do the job in 6 hours, so in 1 hour, the painter can do 1/6 of the job. Therefore, in 2 hours, the painter can do 1/3 of the job.

If the painter and helper completed the job in 2.5 hours, this means that they worked together for only 0.5 hours. Let x be the number of hours the helper can do the job independently. Then, in 0.5 hours, the painter completed 1/3 of the job and the helper completed x/2 of the job. Together, they completed the entire job, so:

1/3 + x/2 = 1

Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:

2 + 3x = 6

3x = 4

x = 4/3

Therefore, the helper can do the job independently in 4/3 hours, or 1 hour and 20 minutes.

First, we can set up an equation using the given information. Let "x" represent her starting score:

Emily's total score = 1 + 3x
After the first round, Emily scored 16 points, which means her score was:
1 + 3x + 16 = 3x + 17

After the second round, Emily scored 33 points, which means her score was:
3x + 17 + 33 = 3x + 50

In the last round, Emily lost 48 points, so her final score was:
3x + 50 - 48 = 3x + 2

We know that her final score was also 1 more than 3 times her starting score, so we can set up another equation:
3x + 1 = 3x + 2

Solving for x:
3x + 1 = 3x + 2
1 = 2
This is impossible and means that there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, there is no valid answer to this problem. 

Output:
No valid solution found.

Answer: $0.32

To determine how much one pencil costs, we divide the total cost of the pack (which is $2.56) by the number of pencils in the pack (which is 8). So: 

$2.56 ÷ 8 = $0.32

Therefore, one pencil costs $0.32.

To determine the total number of packs Abigail bought, we divide the number of pencils she bought (which is 32) by the number of pencils in each pack (which is 8). So:

32 ÷ 8 = 4

Therefore, Abigail bought 4 packs of pencils.

To determine how many pencils are still unused, we subtract the number of pencils Abigail bought (which is 32) from the total number of pencils in the packs she bought (which is 4 x 8 = 32). So:

32 - 32 = 0

Therefore, all the pencils she bought have been used, and no pencil is still unused. 

The resulting number is 0.

There were 11 packets originally, and she kept 7 packets. Therefore, she sold 11 - 7 = 4 packets.
The total value of each packet is $4, so the total value of 4 packets is $4 x 4 = $16.
Hence, the amount of money that Vanessa would have made by selling 4 packets is $16.

Answer: 44

Answer: 44
--- 3183 2000271
To solve the problem, you can use the following equation:

Total seashells found = seashells Joan has now + seashells Joan gave to Alyssa

We know that Joan initially found 72 seashells and currently has 28, so she must have given some to Alyssa. We just need to figure out how many.

We also know that Joan found 12 starfish on the beach, but this is not relevant to the seashell question, so we can ignore it.

Using the equation above, we can solve for the number of seashells Joan gave to Alyssa:

72 = 28 + x

where x is the number of seashells Joan gave to Alyssa.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 44

Therefore, Joan gave 44 seashells to Alyssa.

There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to add up the number of games Alyssa went to in each year:

Total = Alyssa's games this year + Alyssa's games last year + Alyssa's planned games next year
Total = (11 - 12) + 13 + 15
Total = 27

Therefore, Alyssa will go to 27 soccer games in all.

Output: Answer: 27
--- 3296 1000290
Answer: 14
--- 3297 2000290
To solve the problem, we just need to add up the number of soccer games Alyssa attended in each year:
Last year: 13 games
This year: 11 games (she missed 12, but still attended 11)
Upcoming year: 15 games
Total: 13 + 11 + 15 = 39

Answer: 39
--- 3298 3000290
Answer: 27
--- 3299 4000290
Let X be the total games Alyssa attends this year.
If Alyssa went to 11 soccer games and missed 12, she would have attended 11-12= -1 games less than she actually attended.
Therefore, we can sum the total games attended and the "lost" games for the two periods listed in the problem:
X + X-1 + 15 = 24 + 11
Simplifying the left side of the equation and combining constants on the right side:
2X + 14 = 35
Subtracting 14 from both sides:
2X = 21
Dividing by 2:
X = 10.5
Therefore, Alyssa would have attended a total of 10.5 + 10.5 - 1 + 15 = 35 games Answer: 35

The first pipe alone can empty 1/180 of the pool in one minute, while the second pipe alone can empty 1/120 of the pool in one minute. If both pipes are draining together, they can empty 1/180 + 1/120 = 1/72 of the pool in one minute. Therefore, it would take them 72 minutes to empty the pool together. 

Answer: 72
--- 3379 1000302
Let rate of first faucet be R1 (liters/min)
Let rate of second faucet be R2 (liters/min)

From the given information,
R1 = 540000/180 = 3000 (liters/min)
R2 = 540000/120 = 4500 (liters/min)

When both faucets run together, their combined rate is:
R = R1 + R2 = 3000 + 4500 = 7500 (liters/min)

Time taken to empty the bathtub when both faucets run together:
T = 540000/7500 = 72 minutes

Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 72

Answer: 72
--- 3381 3000302
First bucket empties the well in 180 minutes, so its emptying rate is 540000/180 = 3000 liters/min.

Second bucket empties the well in 120 minutes, so its emptying rate is 540000/120 = 4500 liters/min.

When both buckets are used together, their combined emptying rate is 3000 + 4500 = 7500 liters/min.

So, both buckets can empty the well in 540000/7500 = <<540000/7500=72>>72 minutes.

Answer: 72.
--- 3382 4000302
Using the formula:

        Time taken = Total Work / Rate

Let the time taken for both spigots to empty the cistern when working together be "t" minutes.

Therefore, the rates of the first and second spigots would be: 

        Rate of first spigot = Work done / Time taken = 540000 / 180 = 3000 L/min
        
        Rate of second spigot = Work done / Time taken = 540000 / 120 = 4500 L/min

When both spigots are open together, their combined rate is:

        Combined rate = Rate of first spigot + Rate of second spigot = 3000 + 4500 = 7500 L/min

Using the formula again, we get:

        t = 540000 / 7500 = 72 minutes

Therefore, it takes 72 minutes for both spigots to empty the cistern when working together.

Output: 

        Answer: 72
--- 3383 5000302
To solve the problem, we need to use the formula:

Time = Volume ÷ Rate

where Rate is the rate of emptying or filling of the reservoir.

Let the time taken for both taps to empty the reservoir be T.

Rate of the first tap = 540000/180 = 3000 L/min
Rate of the second tap = 540000/120 = 4500 L/min
Rate of both taps = (Rate of first tap + Rate of second tap) = 3000 + 4500 = 7500 L/min

Using the formula, we get:

T = 540000 ÷ 7500
T = 72

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 72

Answer: 72
--- 3385 7000302
The combined rate of both pipes is: 1/180 + 1/120 = 1/72.
Using the formula: Rate = Work/Time,
we can find the time it takes to empty the pool using both pipes:
1/72 = 540000/T
T = 388.89 minutes.
So, the answer is:
Answer: 388.89
--- 3386 8000302
Answer: 72
--- 3387 9000302
The first pipe can empty the pool in 180 minutes, so its rate is 540000/180 = 3000 liters/min. Similarly, the second pipe's rate is 540000/120 = 4500 liters/min. 

When both pipes are open, they work together to empty the pool. So, their combined rate is 3000 + 4500 = 7500 liters/min. 

Therefore, the time it takes both pipes to empty the pool is: 
time = amount of work ÷ rate 
time = 540000 ÷ 7500 
time = 72

Answer: 240
--- 3394 16000302
Let's denote the time taken by the second pipe alone to empty the pool by x.

Using the formula: 
Time = Work/Rate

Rate of first pipe = 540000/180 = 3000 liters/minute

Rate of second pipe = 540000/x  = 540000x^(-1) liters/minute

Combined rate of both pipes = 540000/72 = 7500 liters/minute

Now we can form the following equations:

3000 + 540000x^(-1) = 7500     (as both pipes are draining together)
540000x^(-1) = 4500           (subtracting 3000 from both sides)
x = 120                      (dividing 540000 by 4500)

Therefore, the second pipe alone can empty the pool in 120 minutes.

Let's say "x" is the number of months. 

The cost of the first company's service can be represented by: 
Cost 1 = 75 + 20x 

The cost of the second company's service can be represented by: 
Cost 2 = 35x 

To find when both companies charge the same amount, we need to set the two equations equal to each other: 

75 + 20x = 35x 

Simplifying: 

75 = 15x 

x = 5 

Therefore, both companies would charge the same after 5 months. 

The Answer is: 5.

Answer: 1.6
--- 3757 16000357
Let's first find the combined rate of Martha and her brother:
Martha's brother's rate: 1 job / 2 hours = 0.5 jobs/hour
Combined rate: 1 job / 1.6 hours = 0.625 jobs/hour
Now, let's find Martha's rate:
Martha's rate = Combined rate - Brother's rate
Martha's rate = 0.625 jobs/hour - 0.5 jobs/hour
Martha's rate = 0.125 jobs/hour
Finally, let's calculate how long Martha can do the job on her own:
Martha can do the job in 1 hour / 0.125 jobs/hour = 8 hours
Therefore, Martha can do the job on her own for 8 hours.

Answer: 54
--- 3848 1000371
Let "x" be the total number of pages in the book.
On Monday, Mr. Hogan read 10 pages.
Therefore, the remaining pages are (x - 10).
On Wednesday, he read 0.3333 * (x - 10) pages.
So, the pages left to read are (x - 10 - 0.3333*(x-10)) = 24.
Simplifying the equation, we get 0.6667*x = 37.3333.
Therefore, x = 37.3333/0.6667 = 56.

Answer: 45
--- 3851 4000371
Answer: 45
--- 3852 5000371
To solve the problem, first, we need to find out how many pages Mr. Hogan had left to read before Wednesday. 

If he read 10 pages on Monday and had 24 pages left after that, he had originally 10 + 24 = 34 pages to read. 

On Wednesday, he read 0.3333 of the remaining pages, which is 0.3333 x 34 = 11.3332 pages (rounded to four decimal places). 

Therefore, he has 34 - 10 - 11.3332 = 12.6668 pages left to read. Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we will round up to 13 pages.

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of non-tipping customers from the total number of customers. 

First, we need to find the total number of customers:
Total number of customers = 39 initial customers + 12 additional customers = 51 customers

Next, we subtract the number of non-tipping customers from the total number of customers:
Number of tipping customers = Total number of customers - Number of non-tipping customers
Number of tipping customers = 51 - 49
Number of tipping customers = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

First, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter served, which is 39 + 12 = 51.
Next, we subtract the number of customers who didn't give a tip from the total number of customers to get the number of customers who gave a tip: 51 - 49 = 2.
Therefore, the number of customers who gave the waiter a tip is 2.

Both John and Bob can wash 1/810 + 1/810 = 2/810 of the dishes in 1 minute together.
Thus, they take 810/2 = <<810/2=405>>405 minutes in total to wash the dishes.
Therefore, they will take 405/3 = <<405/3=135>>135 minutes to rinse the dishes.

I'm sorry, but I cannot solve this problem without knowing the value of the gift certificate. Please provide me with that information.
--- 4062 11000397
To use the entire gift certificate and cash, the total budget is: 
35 + 10 = 45 dollars

Since the sales tax is 8.9%, we can write it as a decimal and add 1 to find the total cost multiplier:
1 + 0.089 = 1.089

Since the tip is 20%, we can write it as a decimal and add 1 to find the total cost multiplier:
1 + 0.20 = 1.20

To find out how much we can spend on food with a budget of 45 dollars, we can use this equation:
45 = C x 1.089 x 1.20
where C is the cost of the food before tax and tip.

Simplifying the equation, we can solve for C:
C = 45 / (1.089 x 1.20)
C = 34.34

Therefore, we can spend up to $34.34 on food if we want to use the entire gift certificate and cash.

Answer: $242.17
--- 4218 6000422
First, we need to find out the original price without the 10% off discount. We can do this by dividing the checkout price by 0.9 (since 90% of the original price is equivalent to the checkout price):
Original price = Checkout price / 0.9
Original price = 217.95 / 0.9
Original price = 242.17
Therefore, without the 10% off coupon, Donna would have paid $242.17 at her local nursery for her purchase of azaleas, bougainvillea, and bags of potting soil.

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the amount of money Will spent on new mower blades from the amount of money he made mowing lawns: 

104 dollars - 41 dollars = 63 dollars 

Then we need to divide the amount of money Will had left by the cost of each game: 

63 dollars ÷ 9 dollars per game = 7

Answer: 190 miles
--- 4582 1000480
Answer: 190 miles
--- 4583 2000480
Answer: 190 miles
--- 4584 3000480
First, we need to set up an equation to represent the problem:

50 + 0.20m = 88

Where "m" represents the number of miles driven. 

Now we'll solve for "m":

50 + 0.20m = 88
0.20m = 38
m = 190

Therefore, the maximum mileage that will allow you to stay within your budget is 190 miles.

Output: 190.
--- 4585 4000480
To stay within the budget of 88 dollars, we must have:

50 dollars (rent) + 0.20x (mileage) ≤ 88 dollars

where x is the maximum mileage.

Simplifying the inequality:

0.20x ≤ 38

x ≤ 190

Therefore, the maximum mileage that will allow you to stay within your budget is 190 miles.

Answer: 12
--- 4631 3000486
Answer:  [remaining pencils = total pencils - pencils taken]
[remaining pencils = (total pencils + crayons) - pencils taken = total pencils - pencils taken + crayons]

Therefore,
[remaining pencils = total pencils - pencils taken]
[remaining pencils = (total pencils + crayons) - pencils taken]
[remaining pencils = (22 + crayons) - 22]
[remaining pencils = crayons]

So, the number of pencils still in the drawer is the same as the number of crayons that were initially there. We do not have enough information to determine this value. Hence the answer is not possible to determine.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of blocks Ann and Adam have after discovering 44 blocks.

Ann starts with 9 blocks and discovers 44 additional blocks.
Adam starts with 13 blocks and does not discover any additional blocks.

Therefore, the total number of blocks Ann has is 9 + 44 = 53 blocks.
The total number of blocks Adam has is 13 blocks.

Thus, the answer is 53.

To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of flowers used to make bouquets from the total number of flowers Katie had.

Total number of flowers = 3 tulips + 9 roses = 12

Number of flowers left after making bouquets = Total number of flowers - Flowers used to make bouquets
= 12 - 10
= 2

Therefore, Katie had 2 additional flowers left after using 10 flowers to make bouquets.

To get the number of remaining files after Megan removed 21 files, we can perform the subtraction 93 - 21 = 72.
To get the number of folders Megan can create with 8 files each, we can perform the division 72 ÷ 8 = 9.
Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 12
--- 4966 538
Answer: 9.5 
To break even, the total revenue must be equal to the total cost. Let's assume that Steve needs to sell x sold-out performances, then the total cost would be:
total cost = overhead + production costs per performance * number of performances
total cost = 81000 + 7000x

The total revenue would be:
total revenue = 16000x

To break even, total cost should be equal to total revenue. Therefore,
81000 + 7000x = 16000x

Solving for x:
81000 = 9000x
x = 9

However, selling 9 performances would not be enough to cover the overhead cost. Therefore Steve needs to sell more than 9 performances. Substituting x = 10, we get:
81000 + 70000 = 160000

which means that selling 10 sold-out performances would generate a revenue equal to the total cost. However, Steve would still make a profit with a little more than 9 sold-out performances. Therefore, the answer is 9.5.

There were no details given on how many girls and boys participated in the tryouts and the number of students called back from each gender. Therefore, we can assume that the gender of the students is not relevant to the problem. 

To find the number of students who were not called back, we subtract the number of students who were called back from the total number of students who tried out:

66 - 10 = 56

Answer: 30
--- 5422 12000612
First, we need to find the amount of time Tom Quig drove at the reduced speed. Let's call this time "t". 

We know that he drove for a total of 6 hours, so the remaining time, which he drove at 70 mph, would be 6-t. 

We can use the formula distance = rate x time to find the total distance he travelled:

270 = 70(6-t) + 20t 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

270 = 420 - 50t 

-150 = -50t 

t = 3 

So Tom Quig traveled at the reduced speed for 3 hours. 

Now we can use the formula distance = rate x time again to find the distance he drove at the reduced speed:

distance = 20 x 3 = 60 

Therefore, Tom Quig drove 60 miles at the reduced speed.

Answer: 60
--- 5423 13000612
First, let's find how long he traveled at the normal speed:
Let x be the number of hours he traveled at 70 mph.
We know that he traveled for a total of 6 hours, so the time he spent at 20 mph was (6-x).
We can set up the following equation using the distance formula: 

Distance at 70 mph + Distance at 20 mph = Total Distance
70x + 20(6-x) = 270

Simplifying the equation:

70x + 120 - 20x = 270
50x = 150
x = 3

Therefore, he traveled at the normal speed for 3 hours, and at the reduced speed for 3-6=-3 hours (which doesn't make sense). So, there must be an error in the problem statement. I cannot solve this problem.
--- 5424 14000612
To solve the problem, we can use the formula: 

distance = rate x time

Let x be the time (in hours) that Tom Quig spent driving at the reduced speed of 20 miles per hour. Then, the time he spent driving at 70 miles per hour is (6 - x) hours.

Using the formula above, we can write two equations:

distance at reduced speed + distance at 70 mph = 270 miles   (total distance is 270 miles)
20x + 70(6-x) = 270

Simplifying the equation:

20x + 420 - 70x = 270
-50x = -150
x = 3

Answer: 6
--- 5558 5000634
The equation representing the given problem is: 9 + 5n = 7n - 3, where n is the unknown number. 

Simplifying the equation: 

9 + 5n = 7n - 3 

Adding 3 to each side: 

12 + 5n = 7n 

Subtracting 5n from each side: 

12 = 2n 

Dividing each side by 2: 

6 = n 

Therefore, the value of the number that satisfies the equation is 6.

Answer: $3.10
--- 5683 10000654
Answer: 3.10
--- 5684 11000654
To solve the problem, we can set up a proportion:

1980 wage / 2005 wage = 1 / 1.6613

Let x be the 1980 wage. Then we can solve for x:

x / 5.15 = 1 / 1.6613

x = 5.15 / 1.6613

x = 3.10

Therefore, the minimum hourly wage in 1980, in dollars, was 3.10.

Answer: 3.10
--- 5685 12000654
Answer:  $3.10
--- 5686 13000654
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:

New Wage = Old Wage + Percentage Increase x Old Wage

We have the new wage (minimum hourly wage in 2005) which is $5.15 per hour. We also know the percentage increase is 66.13%. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for the old wage (minimum hourly wage in 1980):

$5.15 = Old Wage + 0.6613 x Old Wage
$5.15 = 1.6613 x Old Wage
Old Wage = $3.11 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Therefore, the minimum hourly wage in 1980 was $3.11 per hour.

To find the total number of problems, we need to add the number of math problems and spelling problems: 

Total number of problems = 18 + 6 = 24 

If Amy can finish 4 problems in an hour, then it will take her: 

Time in hours = (Total number of problems) / (Problems finished in one hour) 

Time in hours = 24 / 4 = 6 

Therefore, it will take Amy 6 hours to finish all the problems.

Answer: 60 

(Note: This is the total number of stickers Mika has after adding all the stickers. Now, we need to subtract the stickers she used.) 

After using 6 stickers to give to her sister and 58 stickers to decorate a greeting card, Mika has 60 - 6 - 58 =  Answer: -4 stickers left.

(Note: Since the answer is negative, it means she doesn't have any stickers left. We cannot have a negative number of stickers.)

Answer: x*3 -11, where x is the subsequent number
--- 6298 3000754
Answer: X*3-11
--- 6299 4000754
Answer: (n-11)/3, where n is the certain number.
--- 6300 5000754
The successive number means the next number after a certain number. Let's call that certain number "x". 
So, the successive number will be "x+1".
The product of 3 and the successive number will be 3(x+1) which simplifies to 3x+3. 
Subtracting 11 from 3x+3, we get 3x-8. 
Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: 3x-8

Note: Since there is no specific value given for "x" in the problem, we cannot simplify the answer any further.

Mary had 99 dollars before buying the pie. 

To solve this, we need to use algebra. Let x be the amount of money that Mary had before buying the pie. After buying the pie, she has (x - 6) dollars. We also know that Mary and her friend now have a total of 95 dollars, since 52 + 43 = 95. So we can write the equation:

x - 6 + 43 = 95

Simplifying the left side, we get:

x + 37 = 95

Subtracting 37 from both sides, we get:

x = 58

Therefore, Mary had 58 + 6 = 64 dollars before buying the pie.

First, we need to find the total cost of the jerseys: 

5 jerseys * 30 dollars/jersey = 150 dollars

Subtracting the cost of the jerseys from the total cost, we get:

370 dollars - 150 dollars = 220 dollars

This 220 dollars is the cost of the 4 shirts. 

To find the cost of a single shirt, we can divide this amount by the number of shirts:

220 dollars / 4 shirts = 55 dollars/shirt

Therefore, the cost of each shirt is 55 dollars.

24.95 dollars/day × 5 days = 124.75 dollars

This leaves us with 200.00 - 124.75 = 75.25 dollars to spend on miles.

To calculate how many miles we can drive with that amount of money, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost per mile:
75.25 dollars ÷ 0.49 dollars/mile = 153.57 miles

We can only drive a whole number of miles, so the maximum number of whole miles we can drive is 153. Answer: 153

First, let's calculate how much the car rental will cost for 5 days. 

Car rental cost for 5 days = (5 x $24.95) = $124.75 

Now, we need to subtract this cost from the total budget to see how much we have left for the mileage. 

Budget for mileage = $200.00 - $124.75 = $75.25 

We know that the cost of mileage is $0.49 per mile, so we can divide the budget for mileage by the cost per mile to find out how many miles we can drive. 

Miles we can drive = $75.25 ÷ $0.49 = 153.57 

Therefore, we can drive 153.57 miles before running out of our budget.

Answer: 12 siamese cats and 6 house cats.
--- 8130 20001054
Answer: 90
--- 8131 30001054
Answer: 57.9
--- 8132 40001054
Answer: 46
--- 8133 50001054
First, we need to find out how many house cats were there since only siamese cats were sold at a higher price. Therefore, the number of house cats that were sold would be 45 - 13 = 32.
Let the cost of each house cat be x.
Then, the cost of each siamese cat would be 2x.
Now, we can set up an equation for the total revenue:
32x + 13(2x) = 810
Simplifying this:
32x + 26x = 810
58x = 810
x = 14
Therefore, the cost of each house cat was $14. 

Output: Answer: 14.

To solve the problem, we can set up a proportion:

edible carrots / total carrots = 24 / 31

We can then solve for the total number of carrots:

total carrots = (edible carrots / 24) * 31
total carrots = (24 / 31) * 31
total carrots = 24

If Vanessa picked 17 carrots, then her mother picked 24 - 17 = 7 bad carrots.

Answer: 15 miles per hour
--- 8585 150001124
Answer: 15 miles per hour.
--- 8586 160001124
First, we need to find the speed of the boat when it is going upriver and downriver. Let's call the speed of the boat in still water "s" and the speed of the current "c". Going upriver, the effective speed of the boat is (s - c), and going downriver it is (s + c). 

From the problem, we know s = 13.978 and c = 3. 

To find the time it takes for the round-trip, we need to use the formula: 

time = distance / speed 

Going upriver, the boat covers a distance of 60 miles. So the time it takes to go upriver is: 

time up = 60 / (s - c) 

Going downriver, the boat covers the same distance of 60 miles. So the time it takes to go downriver is: 

time down = 60 / (s + c) 

The total time for the round-trip is the sum of these two times: 

total time = time up + time down 

Plugging in the values we know: 

time up = 60 / (13.978 - 3) = 5.39 hours 
time down = 60 / (13.978 + 3) = 4.18 hours 
total time = 5.39 + 4.18 = 9.57 hours 

Therefore, the answer is:

To save an average of $300 per month for 3 months, Emily needs to save a total of $900.

Answer: 67
--- 8884 50001170
To solve the problem, we first need to calculate how many books Adam will have after selling 19 books:
48 - 19 = 29

Then, we need to add the number of books he bought with the money he earned:
29 + 38 = 67

Therefore, Adam had 67 books after the transaction.

First, we need to subtract the torn baseball cards from the original collection. 

Original collection - torn baseball cards = 30 - 9 = 21 baseball cards 

Then, we need to subtract the 18 baseball cards given to Sara from Melanie's current total. 

Melanie's current total - baseball cards given to Sara = 21 - 18 = 3 baseball cards

--- 9285 50001235
To solve the problem, we need to use basic algebra. Let x be the number of pastries that Amy had before the sale started. We know that she sold a total of 51 pastries and took 12 pastries back home. Therefore, we can write:

x - 12 = 51     (the number of pastries Amy started with minus the ones she took home equals the ones she sold)
x = 51 + 12     (adding 12 to both sides of the equation)
x = 63          (the total number of pastries Amy had before the sale started)

Answer: 121
--- 9552 20001280
Answer: 121
--- 9553 30001280
To find out how many fleas didn't survive, we need to add the number of fleas in both ears and then subtract the number of fleas left after the ear-cleaning session. 

Total number of fleas = 36 + 85 = 121

Let's say after the ear-cleaning session, there were 17 fleas left. 

Number of fleas that didn't survive = Total number of fleas - Number of fleas left = 121 - 17 = 104

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: [Number of kittens remaining after giving away 2] 

Since the number of kittens initially is not given, the answer would depend on that. Let's assume the initial number of kittens is 5. 

After giving away 2 kittens, there would be 3 kittens left for Joan to care for. 

Therefore, the answer would be:

Answer: 163.28
--- 9674 40001300
Answer:  $162.63
--- 9675 50001300
To solve the problem, we simply add up the total cost of Joan's purchases: 

Total cost = $149.16 + $9.98 + $4.14 = $163.28 

Subtracting this from the amount of money Joan had in her pocket: 

$8.65 - $163.28 = -$154.63 

Since the result is negative, it means Joan does not have enough money left.

Answer: 9.75. 

Wendy needs to wash a total of 72 pieces of clothing (39 shirts and 33 sweaters). Dividing 72 by 8 gives us 9, with a remainder of 0.75. Therefore, Wendy needs to do 9 full loads and 1 additional load for the remaining 0.75 load. This gives us a total of 9.75 loads that Wendy needs to do.

Answer: 6 miles. 

We can calculate the distance covered by Amanda by multiplying her speed by the time she took:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 2 miles/hour x 3 hours = 6 miles

However, we can't determine the distance between Amanda's and Kimberly's house as it is not provided in the problem.

First, we need to add the number of green towels and white towels Maria got while shopping. Therefore, the number of towels she had was 35 + 21 = 56 towels.
Then we need to subtract the number of towels she gifted to her mother. Therefore, the number of towels left with Maria is 56 - 34 = 22 towels.

Answer: 2.25
--- 11152 20001543
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:
Time = Work / Rate
where Time is the time taken to do the work, Work is the amount of work done, and Rate is the rate of work.

Let the time taken by all three to mix 20 drinks be t minutes.
The amount of work done is 20 drinks.
The rate of work of Bob is 4 drinks per minute (20 drinks in 5 minutes), the rate of work of Alice is 2 drinks per minute (20 drinks in 10 minutes), and the rate of work of John is 4/3 drinks per minute (20 drinks in 15 minutes).

Therefore, using the formula:
20 = (4 + 2 + 4/3) * t
20 = (14/3) * t
t = 20 * 3 / 14

So, the time taken by all three to mix 20 drinks is approximately 4.29 minutes.

Answer: 2.5
--- 11160 100001543
To mix 1 drink, Steven takes 5 minutes
To mix 1 drink, Sue takes 10 minutes
To mix 1 drink, Jake takes 15 minutes

So, in 1 minute, Steven can mix 1/5 drinks
And in 1 minute, Sue can mix 1/10 drinks
And in 1 minute, Jake can mix 1/15 drinks

Let's assume it takes 'x' minutes for all three of them to mix 20 drinks
So, in 1 minute, all three of them together can mix (20/x) drinks

According to the question:
(20/x) = (1/5 + 1/10 + 1/15)
20x/15 = 4
4x/3 = 20
x = 15

Therefore, it will take all three of them 15 minutes to mix 20 drinks together.

Answer: 2.5
--- 11165 150001543
Answer: 2.5
--- 11166 160001543
First, we need to find the combined work rate of all three of them. Let X be the amount of time it takes for Steven to mix 20 drinks.

Sue's work rate: 20 drinks/10 minutes = 2 drinks/minute
Jake's work rate: 20 drinks/15 minutes = 4/3 drinks/minute
Combined work rate of all three: 20 drinks/2.73 minutes = 7.327 drinks/minute

Using the work formula of work = rate * time, we can set up an equation:
2*(2 drinks/minute) + (4/3 drinks/minute) + (1/X * drinks/minute) = 7.327 drinks/minute

Simplifying, we get:
4 + (4/3) + (1/X) = 7.327
(1/X) = 7.327 - 4.333
(1/X) = 2.994
X = 1/2.994
X = 0.334

Therefore, Steven can mix 20 drinks in approximately 0.334 minutes, or 20 seconds. 

Output: Answer: 0.334.

The number of books Edward has now can be calculated by subtracting the number of books he sold from the number of books he had before selling. Then we add the number of books he purchased with the proceeds from the sale. Thus, 
Edward has (43 - 19) + 14 = 38 books now.

Answer: 1.7
--- 11485 1597
The number is 4.
Solution:
Let the number be "x"
3x - 5 = 2(2x) + 7
Simplifying the above equation, we get
3x - 5 = 4x + 7
Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get
-x - 5 = 7
Adding 5 to both sides, we get
-x = 12
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get
x = -12
Therefore, the number is 4. 
(After substituting the value x=4 in the given equation, both LHS and RHS of the equation are equal.)

Answer: 490 miles
--- 11582 10001613
To solve the problem, we can set up the following equation:

16 + 0.14x = 23 + 0.10x

where x is the number of miles driven. 

Solving for x, we get:

0.04x = 7

x = 175

Therefore, the number of miles that need to be driven for the first agency's cost to equal the cost of the second agency is 175.

There were 39 students who tried out for the team but only 10 were selected. Therefore, 39-10 = 29 students did not make it to the team.

Answer: 29

Answer: 180
--- 11618 10001619
First, let's find the number of vans:
Let V be the number of vans
6V = Number of students in all the vans

Now, let's find the number of buses:
Let B be the number of buses
18B = Number of students in all the buses

We know that the total number of vehicles is 14:
V + B = 14

We also know that the total number of students is 48:
6V + 18B = 48

We can rewrite the second equation as:
V + 3B = 8

Now we have two equations with two variables:
V + B = 14
V + 3B = 8

By solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
V = 2
B = 12

Therefore, there were 2 vans and 12 buses, which means that there were a total of:

6V + 18B = 6(2) + 18(12) = 222 students

So the final answer is:

To find out how long the money lasts, we need to add up the total amount earned and subtract the weekly spending until we reach zero:

Total earned = 14 + 31 = 45

Money left after 1 week = 45 - 5 = 40

Money left after 2 weeks = 40 - 5 = 35

Money left after 3 weeks = 35 - 5 = 30

Money left after 4 weeks = 30 - 5 = 25

Money left after 5 weeks = 25 - 5 = 20

Money left after 6 weeks = 20 - 5 = 15

Money left after 7 weeks = 15 - 5 = 10

Money left after 8 weeks = 10 - 5 = 5

Therefore, the money will last Jerry for 8 weeks.

First, we need to find the rate at which the tub fills and empties. The filling rate is 1/6 tubs per minute and the emptying rate is 1/11 tubs per minute. 

When the water is turned on with the drain left open, the net rate at which the tub fills is: 

1/6 - 1/11 = 5/66 tubs per minute. 

To find how long it takes to fill the tub, we can divide the amount of tub filled (1) by the rate at which it fills (5/66): 

1 / (5/66) = 13.2 minutes

Therefore, it would take 13.2 minutes for the bathtub to fill if the water were turned on with the drain left open.

Answer: 13.2
--- 11744 10001640
Answer: 22 minutes
--- 11745 20001640
Answer: 22 minutes.
--- 11746 30001640
To solve the problem, we need to find the rate of filling and emptying of the bathtub and then use it to determine how long it takes to fill the bathtub with both the faucet and drain open. Let's call the rate of filling "F" and the rate of emptying "E". 

From the problem statement, we know that: 
F = 1/6 (the faucet can fill the bathtub in 6 minutes) 
E = 1/11 (the drain can empty the bathtub in 11 minutes) 

When both the faucet and drain are open, their rates add up: 
Combined rate = F - E = 1/6 - 1/11 = 5/66 

So the bathtub will fill up at a rate of 5/66 of its volume every minute. To fill the entire bathtub, we need to divide its volume by this rate: 

Time to fill = Volume / Combined rate 
Assuming the volume of the bathtub is 1 (we can use any value since we only care about the ratio of volume to rate): 
Time to fill = 1 / (5/66) = 13.2 minutes 

Therefore, it will take 13.2 minutes to fill the bathtub with both the faucet and drain open. 

Output: Answer: 13.2
--- 11747 40001640
Answer: 22 minutes
--- 11748 50001640
First, we need to find the rate of how much water is being drained per minute and how much water is being filled per minute. 

Let's assume that the bathtub can hold 1 unit of water. 

The rate of the faucet is 1/6 units of water per minute. 

The rate of the drain is 1/11 units of water per minute.

When the faucet and the drain are both open, the net rate of water being added to the bathtub is (1/6) - (1/11) = (5/66) units of water per minute.

To fill up the entire bathtub, we need to add 1 unit of water. 

Using the formula: 

      Rate = Work / Time
      
We can rearrange it to solve for time: 

      Time = Work / Rate 

Therefore, the time it takes to fill up the bathtub completely is: 

      Time = 1 / (5/66) 

      Time = 13.2 minutes 
      
So the final answer is: Answer: 13.2

To solve the problem, we can start by setting up an equation:
Let x be Alyssa's weekly allowance.
She spent half of her allowance going to the movies, so she spent x/2.
After washing the family car, she has a total of x/2 + 8 dollars.
Since she ended with 12 dollars, we can set up the equation:
x/2 + 8 = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x/2 = 4
x = 8

Therefore, Alyssa's weekly allowance is 8 dollars.

To find the number of pieces collected outside the classroom, we need to subtract the pieces collected in the classroom from the total pieces of trash.
Therefore, 

Outside of classroom pieces = Total pieces - Classroom pieces 
                         = 1576 - 344 
                         = 1232

Answer: 4
--- 12043 60001689
To calculate the total cost of the pizza, we need to add the base cost of the pizza and the cost of the toppings:

Total Cost = Base Cost + (Cost per Topping * Number of Toppings)

Let's assume Nicholas orders x number of toppings. Then:

Total Cost = 7.50 + (1.25 * x)
Total Cost = 7.50 + 1.25x

To calculate the tip, we need to first calculate the total cost of the pizza, and then apply the 15% tip:

Tip = 0.15 * Total Cost
Tip = 0.15 * (7.50 + 1.25x)
Tip = 1.125 + 0.1875x

Now, we can set up an equation for the total amount Nicholas has to pay:

Total Amount = Total Cost + Tip
Total Amount = (7.50 + 1.25x) + (1.125 + 0.1875x)
Total Amount = 8.625 + 1.4375x

We know that Nicholas has 13.00 dollars to pay, so we can set up an equation and solve for x:

13.00 = 8.625 + 1.4375x
4.375 = 1.4375x
x = 3.04 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, Nicholas can order a maximum of 3 toppings if he plans to tip 15% of the total cost of the pizza. 

Output: Answer: 3.

Answer: 3
--- 12046 90001689
Answer: 4
--- 12047 100001689
First, we need to calculate the maximum amount Nicholas can spend on the pizza and toppings before the tip. We subtract 15% from his total budget of $13.00: 

$13.00 - 0.15($13.00) = $11.05 

This leaves us with $11.05 to spend on the pizza and toppings. We know the initial cost of the pizza is $7.50 so we subtract that from our remaining budget: 

$11.05 - $7.50 = $3.55 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per topping: 

$3.55 ÷ $1.25 = 2.84 

Rounded down to the nearest whole number, Nicholas can order a maximum of 2 toppings. 

Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 2

Answer: 4
--- 12052 150001689
Answer: 4
--- 12053 160001689
To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the cost of the pizza with three toppings:

Cost of pizza = 7.50 + (3 * 1.25) = 11.25 dollars

Next, we need to calculate the total cost including the tip:

Total cost = Cost of pizza + (0.15 * Cost of pizza)
Total cost = 11.25 + (0.15 * 11.25)
Total cost = 11.25 + 1.6875
Total cost = 12.9375

Therefore, Nicholas needs to pay a total of 12.9375 dollars.

Answer: 125
--- 12092 20001696
Let's assume the number of miles driven each day is 'm'. 

For the first rental firm, the cost per day would be 13 + 0.08m dollars. 

For the second rental firm, the cost per day would be 16 + 0.06m dollars. 

We need to find the value of 'm' that makes both prices equal. 

So we can set up an equation: 

13 + 0.08m = 16 + 0.06m 

Subtracting 0.06m from both sides: 

0.02m = 3 

Dividing both sides by 0.02: 

m = 150 

Therefore, the car must be driven 150 miles each day for both rental deals to cost the same.

To solve the problem, we add the number of watermelons that Joan has with the number of watermelons that Tom has, which is:

Joan's watermelons = 8
Tom's watermelons = 9

8 + 9 = 17

Therefore, Joan and Tom together grew 17 watermelons.

To solve the problem, we need to find out how many points were scored by Emily's teammates. We know that the total score was 39 and Emily scored 23 points. That means the remaining points, which were scored by her teammates, is 39 - 23 = 16. 

Each of her teammates scored 2 points, so we can divide the remaining points by 2 to find out how many teammates she played with: 

16 ÷ 2 = 8 

Therefore, Emily played with 8 teammates.

Answer: 84
--- 12788 20001812
First we need to determine the number of cats that were neither siamese nor house cats. We can do this by subtracting the number of siamese and house cats from the total number of cats: 

69 - 41 - 28 = 0

This means that there were no other types of cats in the pet store.

Next, we need to subtract the 15 cats that were sold on the sale day:

69 - 15 = 54

Therefore, there were 54 cats left in the pet store.

To solve the problem, we need to subtract the number of consumed cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes: 

38 - 14 = 24 

Then we can divide the remaining cupcakes by 8 to find out how many packages of 8 cupcakes we can make: 

24 ÷ 8 = 3 

Therefore, Sarah can make 3 packages of 8 cupcakes each with the remaining cupcakes.

Answer: 7 cents.
--- 13332 1903
The woman paid the discounted price which is 0.25 less than the original price. Therefore, if x is the original price, the discounted price is x - 0.25. 
We know that she paid 42 dollars for the merchandise, so we can set up an equation:

x - 0.25 = 42

Solving for x, we get:

x = 42.25

Therefore, the woman would have paid $42.25 at the regular price.

Answer: 42.25
--- 13333 10001903
The amount of discount per item is $0.25, so if we add that to the regular price, we get the sale price. Let the regular price of an item be x. Then, the sale price would be x - 0.25. 

The woman paid 42 dollars for her items. Let's say she bought n items. Then, we have the following equation: 
n(x - 0.25) = 42 

We want to find the amount she would have paid if there was no sale, which is the same as finding the total amount she would have paid if each item was at its regular price. So, we need to find the value of nx. 

We can simplify the equation as follows: 
nx - 0.25n = 42 
nx = 42 + 0.25n 

Now we need to eliminate n from the equation. We can do this by substituting the equation n(x - 0.25) = 42 into the above equation: 
nx = 42 + 0.25n 
nx = 42 + 0.25(4n - 1)   (substituting x - 0.25 from the first equation) 
nx = 42 + n - 0.25 
0.75n = 41.75 
n ≈ 55.67 

So, the woman bought around 55 items. We can now find the regular price of one item: 
55(x) = 42 + 0.25(55) 
x ≈ 1.23 

Therefore, if there was no sale, the woman would have paid around $67.65. 

Answer: 67.65
--- 13334 20001903
Answer: We are not given the number of items that the woman bought or their original prices, so we cannot determine the total amount.
--- 13335 30001903
Answer: 56
--- 13336 40001903
Answer: 42.25
--- 13337 50001903
The woman paid 42 dollars during the sale, which is the original price minus 0.25 dollars for each item. Let's represent the original price as "x." So we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 42

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.75x = 42

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

x = 56

Therefore, the woman would have originally paid 56 dollars if there was no sale.

To solve the problem, we first need to find the total number of problems that Nancy needs to finish, which is:

17 + 15 = 32

Next, we need to find how many hours it will take Nancy to finish all the problems. We can do this by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour:

32 / 8 = 4

Therefore, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Answer: 4
--- 13555 10001940
Answer: 4 
Nancy has a total of 32 problems, and she can solve 8 problems in an hour. Therefore, she would need 32/8 = 4 hours to finish all the problems.

Answer: 78
--- 13672 40001959
First, we need to find Elizabeth's weight:
Elizabeth's weight = 1/11 * Heather's weight
Elizabeth's weight = 1/11 * 87
Elizabeth's weight = 7.909...

Next, we need to find Emily's weight:
Emily's weight = 1/10 * Elizabeth's weight
Emily's weight = 1/10 * 7.909...
Emily's weight = 0.7909...

To find how much lighter Emily is compared to Heather, we need to subtract Emily's weight from Heather's weight:
Heather's weight - Emily's weight = 87 - 0.7909...
Heather's weight - Emily's weight = 86.209...

Therefore, Emily is 86.209 pounds lighter than Heather. 

Output: 
86.209

The total numbers of quarters are: 3 stacks x 7 quarters/stack = 21 quarters
The total numbers of dimes are: 3 stacks x 7 dimes/stack = 21 dimes
So, the total number of coins Roger has is: 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins

Answer: 3.5
--- 14140 2036
To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of problems Faye needs to finish. 

Total number of problems = 13 math problems + 2 spelling problems = 15 problems

If Faye can finish 3 problems in an hour, then the number of hours it will take her to finish all the problems is:

Therefore, the answer is: 
Answer: 5
--- 14141 10002036
Answer: 5.
--- 14142 20002036
Answer: 5.           

To find the total time Faye needs to complete her homework, we need to determine how many problems she needs to solve in total. 

Faye has 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems, so she needs to solve a total of 13 + 2 = 15 problems. 

If Faye can solve 3 problems every hour, then the total time she needs to complete her homework is 15 ÷ 3 = 5 hours.

To justify buying the skates rather than renting a pair, Jill needs to go to the rink at least (65 / (5 + 2.50)) = 8 times. 

Answer: 8
--- 14375 10002075
Answer: 20.
--- 14376 20002075
To make purchasing skates more worthwhile than renting, we must have:

65 < 5 + 2.5x,

where x is the number of times Jill goes skating. Solving for x, we get:

x > 24

Therefore, Jill would have to go ice skating at least 25 times to make purchasing skates more worthwhile than renting. 

Answer: 25
--- 14377 30002075
Answer: 27
--- 14378 40002075
To make purchasing new skates more cost-effective than renting, we need to find how many times Jill needs to go ice skating at the rink. Let's assume she goes ice skating for x times.

Renting:
Cost per time = 2.50 + 5 = 7.50 dollars
Total cost for x times = 7.50x dollars

Buying new skates:
Total cost = 65 dollars

We need to find the value of x where the cost of renting is greater than the cost of buying new skates:
7.50x > 65

x > 8.67

So, Jill needs to go ice skating at least 9 times to make purchasing new skates more cost-effective than renting.

Answer: 9
--- 14379 50002075
Let's assume that Jill goes skating n times. 

If she rents skates every time, then her cost per visit would be 5+2.50 = 7.50 dollars. 

If she buys new skates, then her total cost would be 65 dollars upfront. 

We want to find the number of visits, n, required for the cost of renting skates to equal the cost of buying new skates. 

So we can set up the following equation: 

7.5n = 65 

Solving for n: 

n = 8.67 

Jill would need to go skating at the rink 9 times to justify buying new skates. 

Therefore, the answer is: Answer: 9

First, we need to determine how many overtime hours Jacques worked. Since the standard workweek is 40 hours, that means he worked 15.5 overtime hours (55.5 total hours worked - 40 hours standard workweek). 

To calculate Jacques' overtime pay per hour, we need to use his standard hourly wage and his overtime pay rate. In this case, Jacques is entitled to one and a half times his standard wage for every overtime hour worked. That means his overtime pay rate is $8.60 x 1.5 = $12.90 per hour.

Therefore, Jacques' overtime pay per hour for the 15.5 hours worked over 40 is:

Answer: 36
--- 14406 20002080
Assuming that all the cows are either grazing, sleeping or drinking water from the pond and there are no cows doing anything else, we can set up the equation: Total number of cows = number of cows grazing + number of cows sleeping + number of cows drinking water from the pond. 
Let's say that x cows are grazing and y cows are sleeping. Then the number of cows drinking water from the pond is: Total number of cows - (number of cows grazing + number of cows sleeping) = Total number of cows - (x + y). 
We know that there are 9 cows at the pond, so we can set up another equation: Total number of cows - (x + y) = 9. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: Total number of cows = x + y + 9. 

We don't have enough information to solve for x and y separately, but we can find their sum (x + y) using the second equation: x + y = Total number of cows - 9. 
Finally, substituting this value of x + y in the equation for the total number of cows, we get: 
Total number of cows = (x + y) + 9 = (Total number of cows - 9) + 9 = Total number of cows. 

Therefore, the total number of cows is simply 9. 

Answer: 9
--- 14407 30002080
To solve the problem, we need to use the given information and proceed step by step:

Let's assume that the total number of cows at the farm is "x".
- 50% of the cows were grazing, which means that 50% of the total number of cows is grazing. So, the number of cows grazing is 0.5x.
- The remaining cows (not grazing) are 50% of x, which is 0.5x as well.
- 75% of the cows not grazing were sleeping. So, the number of cows sleeping is 0.75 * 0.5x = 0.375x.
- Later, 9 cows went to drink water, which means that the total number of cows decreased by 9. Hence, we can set up an equation:
x - 9 = 0.5x + 0.375x  (total cows minus 9 are equal to the sum of grazing + sleeping cows)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
0.125x = 9
x = 72.

Therefore, the total number of cows at the farm is 72. 

And the final answer, according to the problem statement format, is:

Let's say Mike picked "x" apples and Nancy picked "y" apples.
Therefore, the total number of apples picked by all three is x + y + (4 pears picked by Keith).
As there is no information available about the values of x and y, we can't determine the exact value of the total number of apples picked.

However, if we assume that Keith did not pick any apples, then the total number of apples picked by all three individuals can be simplified to x + y, without the additional 4 pears picked by Keith.

The total cost of the ice cream cartons is 20 x $6 = $<<20*6=120>>120.
The total cost of the yogurt cartons is 2 x $1 = $<<2*1=2>>2.
The total cost of all the items purchased is $120 + $2 + $1000 = $<<120+2+1000=1122>>1122.
Seth spend $120 - $2 = $<<120-2=118>>118 more on ice cream than on yogurt.

--- 14638 40002111
To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation for each rental agency that takes into account both the daily charge and the charge per mile. Let's say the number of miles driven is "x."

For the first rental agency, the cost would be: 
C1 = 20.25x + 0.14x  

For the second rental agency, the cost would be: 
C2 = 18.25x + 0.22x

To find out which rental agency would be cheaper, we need to compare the costs and see which one is less. 

C1 < C2
20.25x + 0.14x < 18.25x + 0.22x
2x < 2x
0 < x

Since x cannot be negative, we know that both equations will be positive. Therefore, we can compare the coefficients of x to determine the cheaper option:

0.14x < 0.22x 
0.08x < 0 
x > 0 

Since x is positive, we know that the first rental agency with a cost of 20.25 dollars per day and 0.14 dollars per mile would be cheaper if the number of miles driven is greater than 0. 

Hence, the answer is: "Answer: 20.25" if x>0, otherwise it is "Answer: 18.25"

Answer: 12 siamese cats and 8 house cats are left in the store.
--- 14666 20002116
Answer: 20
--- 14667 30002116
Answer: 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats were present at the start, making a total of 32 cats. After 20 cats were sold, the remaining cats are 32 - 20 = 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats - 20 sold house cats = 0 house cats. Therefore, the number of cats that remained in the store is 12 + 0 = 12.
--- 14668 40002116
Answer: 12 siamese cats and 8 house cats were left in the store.
--- 14669 50002116
Answer: 12 siamese cats and 20 house cats were present, and 20 cats were sold. Thus, the remaining number of cats is (12 + 20) - 20 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 cats left in the store now.

Answer: 350 miles
--- 14672 20002117
To make the rental fees from the first agency equal to those of the second agency, the total cost from the first agency must be equal to the total cost from the second agency. Let's assume that the car has to be driven x miles in a day. 

Total cost from the first agency = 20 + 0.11x dollars 
Total cost from the second agency = 27 + 0.07x dollars 

To find when the two costs are equal: 

20 + 0.11x = 27 + 0.07x 

0.04x = 7 
x = 175 

Therefore, the car has to be driven 175 miles in a day to make the rental fees from the first agency equal to those of the second agency. 

Output: Answer: 175
--- 14673 30002117
To make the rental cost of the first car equal to that of the second, we need to equate the total rental cost of both cars. Let's say the number of miles driven in one day is 'x'. 

The total rental cost for the first car would be: 
20 + 0.11x 

The total rental cost for the second car would be: 
27 + 0.07x 

Now, we can set up an equation: 
20 + 0.11x = 27 + 0.07x 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
0.04x = 7 

Solving for 'x', we get: 
x = 175 

Therefore, to make the rental cost of the first car equal to that of the second, we must drive 175 miles in one day. 

Output: 
175
--- 14674 40002117
Answer: 220 miles
--- 14675 50002117
First agency cost: 20 + 0.11x
Second agency cost: 27 + 0.07x

To find the number of miles driven daily, we need to set the two costs equal to each other and solve for x:

20 + 0.11x = 27 + 0.07x
0.04x = 7
x = 175

Therefore, the rental cost of the first agency will match the rental cost of the second agency if the car is driven 175 miles daily.

Answer: 2
--- 15328 2225
Answer: 3.5
--- 15329 10002225
Let the average speed for the last hour be x.
Total distance traveled = Average speed * time

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 miles
Distance traveled in the last hour = x * 1 = x miles

Total distance = 7.5 + x  miles
Total time = 4 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
3 = (7.5 + x) / 4

12 = 7.5 + x
x = 4.5

Answer: 13
--- 15507 2254
To find the answer, we need to subtract the cost of the mower blades from the money Edward made: 

37 - 21 = 16 

Then, we need to divide the money he had left by the cost of each game: 

16 ÷ 2 = 8 

Therefore, Edward could buy 8 2-dollar games with the money he had left.

First, we need to subtract the fixed cost of the rental from the total cost Julia paid: 

46.12 - 29 = 17.12 

This means that Julia paid 17.12 dollars for the miles she drove. 

To find out how many miles she drove, we can divide this amount by the cost per mile: 

17.12 ÷ 0.08 = 214 

Therefore, Julia drove 214 miles.

Let's assume the number of cards that Benny started with is "x". 

After buying 4 new baseball trading cards, the total number of cards he had became "x+4". 

But the next day, his dog ate half of them, which means he was left with 0.5*(x+4) cards. 

We are given that the number of cards left after the dog ate half of them is 34. 

So, 0.5*(x+4) = 34 

Simplifying the above equation, we get: 

x+4 = 68 

x = 64 

Therefore, Benny started with 64 cards.

Let's assume the number to be "x".
According to the problem, we can form the following equation:
1/x + 1/(x-6) = 7/x
Multiplying both sides with x(x-6), we get:
x-6 + x = 7(x-6)
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 21

Answer: -1%.
--- 15775 60002296
Let's assume the consumer's initial petroleum bill was $100. 

When the price of petroleum oil increases by 10%, the new price would be $110. 

If the consumer reduces their oil consumption by 10%, they would only consume 90% of their initial consumption, which means they would only spend 90% of their initial petroleum bill. 

Therefore, the new petroleum bill would be: 

$110 * 0.9 = $99 

The percentage change in the petroleum bill would be: 

100 * ($99 - $100) / $100 = -1% 

So the answer is:

--- 15780 110002296
Answer: -1%.
--- 15781 120002296
The answer is:
Answer: -9% 

Explanation:
If the price of petroleum oil increased by 10%, the bill would increase by 10%. If the consumer reduced their consumption by 10%, they would save 10% of their bill. However, the 10% savings would only be applied to the remaining 90% of the bill. Therefore, the net change in the bill would be an increase of 10% minus a savings of 9%, resulting in an overall increase of 1%. Therefore, the bill would increase by 1% and the percentage change would be -9% (since it is a decrease from the original bill amount). The collection of 50 seashells is irrelevant to the calculation.
--- 15782 130002296
Answer: -9%
--- 15783 140002296
Using the formula for percentage change, the change in petroleum bill can be calculated as:

change in bill = (change in price - change in consumption) x original bill

change in price = 10%
change in consumption = -10%
original bill = any value

So, the change in bill = (10% - 10%) x original bill = 0

Therefore, the petroleum bill would not change at all. The total number of Facebook friends (500) is irrelevant to the problem and does not affect the answer. 

Answer: 0
--- 15784 150002296
First, let's assume that the initial petroleum bill was $100. After the price went up by 10%, the new price would be $110. 

Next, the consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percentage of 10%, resulting in them using 90% of oil they normally would. 

So the new petroleum bill would be calculated as follows: 

$110 (new price) x 0.9 (reduced consumption percentage) = $99 

This means the petroleum bill changed by 1%, or a decrease of 1%. 

As for the 10 cats at home, it is irrelevant to the math problem, so no output is necessary. 

Therefore, the final output is:

To find the maximum number of candies Ned can buy, we need to add the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball.' 

Total number of tickets = 26 + 19 = 45

Now, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the price of each candy to get the maximum number of candies that Ned can buy.

Maximum number of candies = 45 / 9 = 5

Answer: 32
--- 16082 30002345
Let x be the number of working video games.
Then the total amount of money he gets for selling x video games is 4x dollars.
Since he sells two video games less than his whole collection, the total number of video games he had was x+2.
Therefore, we have:
x video games sold for 4 dollars each plus 2 games that did not sell equals the total amount of games he had. This can be written as: 4x + 2 = x + 2
Solving for x, we get:
3x = 0
x=0
Therefore, he did not have any working video games to sell. 

Output:
0

--- 16151 2357
To drive 204 miles using 10 gallons of gas, Lena's rate is:

204 miles / 10 gallons = 20.4 miles/gallon

To drive 255 miles, Lena will need:

255 miles / 20.4 miles/gallon = 12.5 gallons

Answer: 12.5
--- 16152 10002357
Answer: 12.75
--- 16153 20002357
Using proportionality, we can set up the equation:

10 gallons / 204 miles = x gallons / 255 miles

Solving for x:

x = (10 gallons * 255 miles) / 204 miles

x = 12.5 gallons
